/*2. Arrays!
Consider the following array:*/

let favoriteAnimals = ["blowfish", "capricorn", "giraffe", "dolphin"];
favoriteAnimals.push("turtle");//2.1 Add a statement that adds Mauro's favorite animal 'turtle' to the existing array.
console.log(favoriteAnimals);//2.2 Log your new array!
favoriteAnimals.splice(1, 0, "meerkat")//2.3 Now add Jim's favorite animal to the array, it's 'meerkat', but make sure it will be placed after 'blowfish' and before 'capricorn'.
console.log("I think the new vale of the array will be five elements")//2u.4 Write a console.log statement that explains in words you think the new value of the array is.
console.log(favoriteAnimals);//2.5 Log your new array!

console.log('The array has a length of'+ ' ' +favoriteAnimals.length) //2.6 Log the length of the array, add a message: 'The array has a length of: ' (here you should show the length of the array).

//2.7 Jason does not like 'giraffe', delete this animal from the array.
//2.8 Again log your new array.
favoriteAnimals.pop()
let removedFavoriteAnimal = favoriteAnimals.pop();
console.log(removedFavoriteAnimal);
console.log(favoriteAnimals);

//2.9 Now if unlike Jim, you don't like 'meerkat' and you want to delete it from the array, but you don't know the position or the index of the item in the array, how can you find it?
let meerkatIndex = favoriteAnimals.indexOf("meerkat"); // finding the position of meerkat
favoriteAnimals.splice(meerkatIndex, 1)
console.log("The item you are looking for is at index " + meerkatIndex) //2.10 Log the index of 'meerkat'. Add a message so it says: 'The item you are looking for is at index: ' (here you should show the index of the item).
